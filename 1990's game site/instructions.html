            <h3>Goal of the game</h3>
            <p>The goal of this game is for Mario to make it to the end of the map to save Princess Peach from Bowser. Mario must overcome obstacles and fight enemies along the way to Bowser's castle.</p>
            <h3>Starting and time</h3>
            <p>Mario starts at the beginning of the area. Once playing starts, a clock in the corner will start timing. However much time is left on the clock will be added as bonus points onto your score.</p>
            <h3>Finishing point</h3>
            <p>At the end of each castle there is a flag pole. The higher you jump onto the pole, the more bonus points you will receive. </p>
            <h3>Bonus prizes</h3>
            <li>1 mushroom gets you an extra life</li>
            <li>100 coins gets you an extra life</li>
            <li>Mystery boxes can be anything</li>
            <h3>Mario, Super Mario, Invincible Mario, etc.</h3>
            <p>Mushrooms that have been disguised as blocks will reward you by giving you a power boost. These modes make Mario invincible. When Fire Mario and Super Mario encounter a bad guy, they don't die, they simply just turn back into regular Mario. </p>        </div>
